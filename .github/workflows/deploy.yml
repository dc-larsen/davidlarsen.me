# GitHub Actions Workflow for Nuxt.js Static Site Deployment to GitHub Pages
# This workflow replaces the default Jekyll deployment with a custom Nuxt build process
# 
# TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES:
# - If assets return 404 errors, check that this workflow is running successfully
# - If old assets are served, ensure .nojekyll file exists and has recent timestamp
# - Asset filenames should match between local .output/public/_nuxt/ and deployed site
# - Build ID in deployed HTML should match local build (check _payload.json?<build-id>)
