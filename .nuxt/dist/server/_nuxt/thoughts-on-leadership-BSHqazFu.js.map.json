The book pushed me toward leader-leader thinking.

The quickest unlock I have seen is swapping \"Can I…?\" for \"I intend to…\". It forces clear thinking. What is the goal. What is the risk. Where are the guardrails. How do we roll back.

The team was already doing great work - they just needed systems to scale their impact.

Pick one area where your team asks permission frequently. Replace the approval process with an \"I intend to...\" template that includes:</p>\n      \n      <ul>\n        <li>Clear objective</li>\n        <li>Risk assessment</li>\n        <li>Rollback plan</li>\n        <li>Success metrics</li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <p>Run it for two weeks.

It's about creating environments where good answers emerge quickly and safely.
