Set the intent, raise the floor, and get out of the way.</p>\n      \n      <p>Two things shaped how I lead: David Marquet's <em>Turn the Ship Around!</em> and my time in support engineering at Contrast Security. The book pushed me toward leader-leader thinking.

The quickest unlock I have seen is swapping \"Can I…?\" for \"I intend to…\". It forces clear thinking. What is the goal. What is the risk. Where are the guardrails. How do we roll back. When intent statements show up every day, the team stops waiting around.
