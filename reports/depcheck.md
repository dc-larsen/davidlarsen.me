# Dependency Check Report

## Overview
This report shows the results of running `depcheck` to identify unused Node.js dependencies.

## Results

### Unused devDependencies Detected by depcheck
The following devDependencies were flagged as unused by depcheck:

1. **@nuxt/devtools** - KEEP (Build/dev tool for Nuxt.js)
2. **autoprefixer** - KEEP (Used by PostCSS in build process)
3. **playwright** - REMOVE (Added during this analysis, not part of original project)
4. **postcss** - KEEP (Required for Tailwind CSS processing)
5. **puppeteer** - REMOVE (Added during this analysis, not part of original project)
6. **sharp** - KEEP (Used by Nuxt for image optimization)

### Analysis

#### Keep (Build-time/CLI dependencies):
- **@nuxt/devtools**: Development experience enhancement for Nuxt.js
- **autoprefixer**: Required for CSS vendor prefixing via PostCSS
- **postcss**: Required by Tailwind CSS and Nuxt build process
- **sharp**: Image optimization library used by Nuxt.js during build

#### Remove (Analysis artifacts):
- **playwright**: Installed during this refactoring analysis, not needed for production
- **puppeteer**: Installed during this refactoring analysis, not needed for production

### Recommendation

**Remove the following dependencies** that were added during this analysis:
```bash
npm uninstall playwright puppeteer
```

**Keep all other flagged dependencies** as they are build-time tools that depcheck may not properly detect usage for.

### Notes

- depcheck often flags build-time and CLI tools as unused because it analyzes import statements, not build configurations
- Nuxt.js framework dependencies are typically configured rather than imported
- PostCSS and Tailwind CSS dependencies are used through configuration files rather than direct imports

## Summary

- **Total flagged:** 6 packages
- **Actually unused:** 2 packages (analysis artifacts)
- **Safe to remove:** playwright, puppeteer
- **Must keep:** 4 packages (build tools)
