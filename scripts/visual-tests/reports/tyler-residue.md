# Tyler Residue Report

## Overview
This report documents any remaining references to "Tyler" or the original site that this project was derived from.

## Findings

### 1. README.md References (KEEP - Attribution)
**File:** `/README.md`

**Lines found:**
- "Special thanks to [Tyler Howard](https://github.com/tylernhoward) for the original inspiration and website concept! ðŸ™Œ"
- "Check out his awesome project: [tylernhoward.github.io](https://github.com/tylernhoward/tylernhoward.github.io)"
- "This site started as a template from Tyler's work and evolved into a security-hardened, modern implementation with Nuxt 3."

**Recommendation:** **KEEP** - These are proper attribution credits and should remain.

### 2. CSS Comment Reference (NEUTRAL)
**File:** `/assets/css/main.css`

**Line found:**
- "/* Custom styles preserving original design */"

**Recommendation:** **KEEP** - This is a generic comment about preserving design, not specifically about Tyler.

### 3. Other "Template" References (CONTENT-RELATED)
**Files:** Various Vue templates and content files

**Context:** Multiple occurrences of the word "template" were found, but these are:
- Vue.js template tags (`<template>`)
- Content references to decision-making templates in blog posts
- General use of the word "template" in documentation

**Recommendation:** **KEEP** - These are legitimate content and code, not residue from the original site.

## Summary

**Total Tyler-specific references:** 3 (all in README.md)
**Recommendation:** Keep all references as proper attribution
**Action needed:** None

### Analysis Notes
1. No hardcoded references to Tyler's personal information in code
